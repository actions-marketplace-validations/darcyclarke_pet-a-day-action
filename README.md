## Installation / Usage

1. Create a `.github/workflows/pet-a-day.yml` file in any repo...
2. Add the following...

```yaml
name: "Pet-a-Day"
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 0 * * *"
jobs:
  update-avatar:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: darcyclarke/pet-a-day-action@v1.0.5
      with:
        email:  ${{ secrets.EMAIL }}
        password: ${{ secrets.PASSWORD }}
```

## Inputs

#### `email`

* **Required** The primary email used for your GitHub account
* **Note:** You should use [GitHub Action Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets) to set this value (re. `https://github.com/<username>/<repo>/settings/secrets/actions`)

#### `password`

* **Required** The password associated with your Gravatar/WordPress.com account
* **Note:** You should use [GitHub Action Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets) to set this value (re. `https://github.com/<username>/<repo>/settings/secrets/actions`)

#### `query`

* **Optional** Comma delimited list of categories to be used to choose the image (ex. `frogs,birds`)
* **Default** `dog,cat,dogs,cats,kittens,puppies,puppy,kitten`

## F.A.Qs

* "How long does it take to see an update?"
  * After a job run it can take a few minutes to see your profile update based on GitHub's caching (you can confirm a new photo was uploaded/mapped by checking [Gravatar](http://en.gravatar.com/))
* "How often should I run this?"
  * Up to you... I think daily is fun/nice... be mindful of the platforms limitations/policies though ‚ù§Ô∏è 
* "How does this work?"
  * Under the hood, we use [**unsplash.com**](https://unsplash.com/)'s random image endpoint along with the defined `query` (aka. "categories") param to fetch a lovely animal image, upload that to Gravatar, set it as the default profile photo & thus, setting it as your default GitHub profile photo (* if you followed the steps above of course...)
